Chisel & Saw
========================================================================================================================

This mod is based on [an official example mod](https://github.com/anegostudios/vschiselmodsample). I consider this to be
the same basic work, just given the polish it deserves.

While the repository is under the same license as the original example mod, all content that was not part of the original
example is to be considered CC0.


TODO:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Chisel item does not fit on tool racks properly.
* Fix the inventory item transparency issues.
* Inlays. At least gems and precious metals, but possibly any ol' thing.
* Apply AO (requires new engine feature).
* Fix the block breaking decals (requires new engine feature).
