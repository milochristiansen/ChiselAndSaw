Chisel & Saw
========================================================================================================================

This mod is based on [an official example mod](https://github.com/anegostudios/vschiselmodsample). I consider this to be
the same basic work, just given the polish it deserves.

While the repository is under the same license as the original example mod, all content that was not part of the original
example is to be considered CC0.


TODO:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fix rare mesh holes. They are always one tile wide or tall, so probably an off-by-one error.
* Fix the inventory item transparency issues.
* Block matrial and other properties should be based on the source block type (needs two chiseled block varients, wood and stone).
* Compress the voxel data.
* Apply AO (requires new engine feature).
* Fix the block breaking decals (requires new engine feature).
