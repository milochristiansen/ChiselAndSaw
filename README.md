Chisel & Saw
========================================================================================================================

This mod is based on [an official example mod](https://github.com/anegostudios/vschiselmodsample). I consider this to be
the same basic work, just given the polish it deserves.

While the repository is under the same license as the original example mod, all content that was not part of the original
example is to be considered CC0.


TODO:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Show the current model while in inventory.
* Change to using a bitmap instead of a bool array for voxel data.
* Player faceing based rotation.
* Block matrial and other properties should be based on the source block type.
* Greedy meshing.
