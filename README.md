Chisel & Saw
========================================================================================================================

This mod is based on [an official example mod](https://github.com/anegostudios/vschiselmodsample). I consider this to be
the same basic work, just given the polish it deserves.

While the repository is under the same license as the original example mod, all content that was not part of the original
example is to be considered CC0.


TODO:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fix the texture issues.
* Allow other voxel sizes, probably by shift+right clicking to cycle modes.
* Allow picking up and placing chiseled blocks.
* Greedy meshing.
